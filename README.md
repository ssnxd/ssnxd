Hey, I’m Suraj 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer who likes building things that ship and don’t fall apart later. I work mostly with TypeScript, Node.js, and Go, and I care a lot about clean architecture, performance, and keeping systems simple.

I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end and thinking beyond just code — product, trade-offs, and long-term maintainability included.

Open to new opportunities — full-time or contract.
